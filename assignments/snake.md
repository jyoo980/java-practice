[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) is a game that has been a source of joy and thousands of hours of lost productivity for many, many students. In this project, you'll have the task of drilling down into the source code behind a small implementation of Snake and writing tests to ensure the correctness of a class.

## Requirements

1. Draw a control-flow diagram for: `Snake.move()`
2. Draw a control-flow diagram for: `SnakeGame.update()`
3. Complete the test class `SnakeTest.java`

## Things to remember

As we delve deeper into program design, I want to make sure we start to think about <strong>SOLID</strong> software engineering principles. When you complete the design of `SnakeTest.java`, make sure to follow the <i>Single Responsibility Principle</i>, think about how you can break down a big method into smaller components.
