# student-record

When designing and engineering systems, it is impossible for a developer to think of 
every use case, or every scenario that their system may be subjected to. In other words, a
perfectly engineered software system is impossible to create.

This is why some programming languages provide what are called `exceptions`. These are constructs
which help your code handle "exceptional" cases in program execution. These can range from
incorrect values provided by the end-user, or even power failures or an inability to connect with
the internet.

Your task will be to complete the TODOs in the project  `StudentRecord`, and make sure that all
tests in the `test` package pass. Take this project as an opportunity to analyse a software system
that you are unfamiliar with, and try to consider some of the design choices made while designing this 
system. Use the following questions to guide you

1. Is there a separation of concerns apparent in the system?
2. Do all the exceptions account for most of the exceptional use cases which may arise?
