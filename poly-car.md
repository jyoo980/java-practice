# polymorphic-car

In this week's assignment, we'll start to explore common problems/scenarios which arise in software engineering and design, and together, tackle ways we can solve these problems. Take a look at the `PolymorphicCar` project. The project structure will be familiar to you, we're going to focus on the two classes `Convertible.java` and `TowTruck.java`. 

You're going to do a high-level design analysis of these two classes. Here is what you'll need to do.

1. Compare the two classes line-by-line. What can you tell about their structure?
	* Do they follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)? Why or why not?
	* In terms of the methods found in each class, do they share similar logic?
	* What are some of the similar properties (fields) that each class share?

2. Run all tests in the `test` folder. If you feel like it is necessary, write more tests to help obtain better code coverage.
